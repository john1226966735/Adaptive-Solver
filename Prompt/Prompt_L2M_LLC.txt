Q: Take the last letters of the words in "think machine" and concatenate them.
A: Create sequential sublists of the list "think machine":
1. "think"
2. "think machine"
Concatenate the last letters of the words within each sublist sequentially:
1. "think": The last letter of "think" is "k".
2. "think machine": "think" outputs "k". The last letter of "machine" is "e". Concatenating "k", "e" leads to "ke".
The answer is "ke".

Q: Take the last letters of the words in "learning reasoning generalization" and concatenate them.
A: Create sequential sublists of the list "learning reasoning generalization":
1. "learning"
2. "learning reasoning"
3. "learning reasoning generalization"
Concatenate the last letters of the words within each sublist sequentially:
1. "learning": The last letter of "learning" is "g".
2. "learning reasoning": "learning" outputs "g". The last letter of "reasoning" is "g". Concatenating "g", "g" leads to "gg".
3. "learning reasoning generalization": "learning reasoning" outputs "gg". The last latter of "generalization" is "n". Concatenating "gg", "n" leads to "ggn".
The answer is "ggn".
