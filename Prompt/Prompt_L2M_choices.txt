Q: Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, how old is Kody?
Answer Choices: (a) 33 (b) 32 (c) 16 (d) 20
A: Let’s break down this problem: 1. How old is Mohamed currently? 2. How old was Mohamed four years ago? 3. How old was Kody four years ago? 4. How old is Kody?
1. We were told that Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, so he is currently 30 * 2 = 60 years old. The answer is 60.
2. That means that four years ago he must have been 60 - 4 = 56 years old. The answer is 56.
3. Four years ago, Kody was half as old as Mohamed, so Kody must have been 56 / 2 = 28 years old then. The answer is 28.
4. Since Kody was 28 years old four years ago, she must now be 28 + 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32.
Therefore, the answer is (b).

Q: Carla bought 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups on clearance. Each bag was $6.00 but was 75% off. How much did she spend on 2 bags of candy?
Answer Choices: (a) 1.5 (b) 6 (c) 5 (d) 3
A: Let’s break down this problem: 1. How much did she spend on 2 bags of candy?
1. Each bag was $6.00 but was 75% off. So each bag cost $6.00 * (1 - 0.75) = $6.00 * 0.25 = $1.50. Carla bought 2 bags. So she spent $1.50 * 2 = $3.00. The answer is 3.
Therefore, the answer is (d).

Q: If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena is, and in 10 years Rena will be 5 years older than her, how old is Pam now?
Answer Choices: (a) 5 (b) 10 (c) 15 (d) 20 (e) 30
A: Let’s break down this problem: 1. How much older is Rena than Pam currently? 2. How old is Pam now?
1. Since Rena will be 5 years older than Pam in 10 years, she must be 5 years older than Pam now as well. The answer is 5.
2. If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena, that means that Rena is currently twice as old as Pam is. So if P stands for Pam’s age now and R stands for Rena’s age now, then we know that R = 2 * P And since Rena is 5 years older than Pam now, we know that R = P + 5. By substitution, we have P + 5 = 2 * P, which means that P = 5. The answer is 5.
Therefore, the answer is (a).

Q: Cappuccinos cost $2, iced teas cost $3, cafe lattes cost $1.5 and espressos cost $1 each. Sandy orders some drinks for herself and some friends. She orders three cappuccinos, two iced teas, two cafe lattes, and two espressos. How much change does she receive back for a twenty-dollar bill?
Answer Choices: (a) 20 (b) 17 (c) 3 (d) 1
A: Let’s break down this problem: 1. How much did the cappuccinos cost in total? 2. How much did the iced teas cost in total? 3. How much did the cafe lattes cost in total? 4. How much did the espressos cost in total? 5. How much did Sandy spend on drinks? 6. How much change does she receive back for a twenty-dollar bill?
1. Sandy ordered three cappuccinos, which cost $2 each, so she spent $2 * 3 = $6 on cappuccinos. The answer is 6.
2. She ordered two iced teas, which cost $3 each, so she spent $3 * 2 = $6 dollars on ice teas. The answer is 6.
3. She ordered two cafe lattes, which cost $1.5 each, so she spent $1.5 * 2 = $3 on cafe lattes. The answer is 3.
4. She ordered two espressos, which cost $1 each, so she spent $1 * 2 = $2 on espressos. The answer is 2.
5. So altogether, Sandy spent $6 + $6 + $3 + $2 = $17 on drinks. The answer is 17.
6. Sandy will get $20 - $17 = $3 as change. The answer is 3.
Therefore, the answer is (c).
