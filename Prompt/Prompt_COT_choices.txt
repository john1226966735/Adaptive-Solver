Q: Four years ago, Kody was only half as old as Mohamed. If Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, how old is Kody?
Answer Choices: (a) 33 (b) 32 (c) 16 (d) 20
A: We were told that Mohamed is currently twice 30 years old, so he is currently 30 * 2 = 60 years old. That means that four years ago he must have been 60 - 4 = 56 years old. Four years ago, Kody was half as old as Mohamed, so Kody must have been 56 / 2 = 28 years old then. Since Kody was 28 years old four years ago, she must now be 28 + 4 = 32 years old. The answer is 32.
Therefore, the answer is (b).

Q: Carla bought 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups on clearance. Each bag was $6.00 but was 75% off. How much did she spend on 2 bags of candy?
Answer Choices: (a) 1.5 (b) 6 (c) 5 (d) 3
A: Each bag was $6.00 but was 75% off. So each bag cost $6.00 * (1 - 0.75) = $6.00 * 0.25 = $1.50. Carla bought 2 bags. So she spent $1.50 * 2 = $3.00. The answer is 3.
Therefore, the answer is (d).

Q: If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena is, and in 10 years Rena will be 5 years older than her, how old is Pam now?
Answer Choices: (a) 5 (b) 10 (c) 15 (d) 20 (e) 30
A: Since Rena will be 5 years older than Pam in 10 years, she must be 5 years older than Pam now as well. If Pam is currently twice as young as Rena, that means that Rena is currently twice as old as Pam is. So if P stands for Pam’s age now and R stands for Rena’s age now, then we know that R = 2 * P And since Rena is 5 years older than Pam now, we know that R = P + 5. By substitution, we have P + 5 = 2 * P, which means that P = 5. The answer is 5.
Therefore, the answer is (a).

Q: Cappuccinos cost $2, iced teas cost $3, cafe lattes cost $1.5 and espressos cost $1 each. Sandy orders some drinks for herself and some friends. She orders three cappuccinos, two iced teas, two cafe lattes, and two espressos. How much change does she receive back for a twenty-dollar bill?
Answer Choices: (a) 20 (b) 17 (c) 3 (d) 1
A: Sandy ordered three cappuccinos, which cost $2 each, so she spent $2 * 3 = $6 on cappuccinos. She ordered two iced teas, which cost $3 each, so she spent $3 * 2 = $6 dollars on ice teas. She ordered two cafe lattes, which cost $1.5 each, so she spent $1.5 * 2 = $3 on cafe lattes. She ordered two espressos, which cost $1 each, so she spent $1 * 2 = $2 on espressos. So altogether, Sandy spent $6 + $6 + $3 + $2 = $17 on drinks, which means that sandy will get $20 - $17 = $3 as change. The answer is 3.
Therefore, the answer is (c).
